    <h1>Smart Tools – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-12-11</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Smart Tools</strong>
      (the “App”) handles information. The App is developed and published by
      <strong>Vlady's Tools</strong> (the “Developer”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Smart Tools is a collection of device utilities, including a flashlight,
      spirit level, inclinometer, compass, screen tester, lux meter, sound
      meter, metal detector, QR / barcode scanner with OCR, and moon phase tools.
      The App is designed to work <strong>locally on your device</strong> and does
      not require you to create an account or provide personal details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App itself <strong>does not collect, store or transmit personally identifiable
      information (PII)</strong> such as your name, email address, phone number or
      contact details. Some limited information may be collected by third-party
      advertising services, as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information the App does NOT collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect or store:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers or contact information</li>
      <li>Passwords, login details or account information</li>
      <li>Precise location (GPS)</li>
      <li>Contact list, calendar events or SMS messages</li>
      <li>User-generated content outside of the App’s own temporary processing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. On-device sensor data</h2>
    <p>
      Smart Tools uses your device’s hardware sensors to provide its utilities.
      Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera and flash for the flashlight, QR / barcode scanner and OCR</li>
      <li>Microphone for the sound meter (decibel level)</li>
      <li>Accelerometer and gyroscope for the spirit level and inclinometer</li>
      <li>Magnetometer for the compass and metal detector</li>
      <li>Light sensor for the lux meter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sensor readings are used <strong>only in real time</strong> to display measurements
      and are <strong>not uploaded to any server</strong> by the Developer. When you close
      a tool, the sensor use stops.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Camera, photos and OCR</h2>
    <p>
      The App can use the camera to scan QR / barcodes or capture images for
      optical character recognition (OCR). You may also choose to import images
      from your device. These images are processed locally on your phone or
      tablet to extract codes or text needed for the tool’s functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Developer does not access, copy, transmit or store your photos or
      images on any external server. Export features (for example, saving or
      sharing CSV/PDF files with scan results) are fully under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Advertising and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      Smart Tools may display ads, including rewarded ads, using
      <strong>Google AdMob</strong> or other advertising providers. These third-party
      services may collect certain device information (such as advertising ID,
      approximate location, and usage data) in accordance with their own
      privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data is used for purposes such as ad delivery, frequency capping and
      measuring performance. The Developer does not receive personally
      identifiable information from these providers.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      For more details, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for general audiences and is not directed specifically
      at children under the age of 13. The App does not knowingly collect
      personal information from children. If you believe that a child has
      provided personal information through the App, please contact the
      Developer so that such information can be removed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      The App itself does not maintain online accounts or remote databases.
      Measurement results or scanned codes are stored only locally on your
      device and can be cleared from within the App (for example, by using
      a “clear” or “delete” option).
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can control permissions such as camera, microphone or storage at any
      time via your device settings. If you revoke a permission, the related
      tool or feature may become unavailable, but the rest of the App will
      continue to function where possible.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The Developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any
      changes will be published on this page with an updated “Last updated”
      date. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted will be
      regarded as acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the
      App’s data practices, please contact:
