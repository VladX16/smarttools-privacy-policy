    <h1>Smart Tools – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-12-11</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application
      <strong>Smart Tools</strong> (the “App”) handles information. The App is
      developed and published by <strong>Vlady's Tools</strong> (the “Developer”).
      By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Smart Tools is a collection of utilities that use your device’s hardware
      sensors, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flashlight / torch</li>
      <li>Spirit level and inclinometer</li>
      <li>Compass</li>
      <li>Screen test</li>
      <li>Lux (light) meter</li>
      <li>Sound level meter (decibels)</li>
      <li>Metal detector</li>
      <li>QR / barcode scanner and OCR text reader</li>
      <li>Moon phases and related information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App is designed to work locally on your device. It does
      <strong>not</strong> require an account or login, and the Developer does
      <strong>not</strong> personally identify users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Personal data and PII</h2>
    <p>
      The Developer does not collect, store, or process information that directly
      identifies you as an individual (such as your name, email address, phone
      number, or postal address).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some third-party services used in the App (in particular
      advertising and billing services) may collect certain device information for their own
      purposes, as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data the App does NOT collect</h2>
    <p>The App, as implemented by the Developer, does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, email addresses, or contact details (beyond the support email you choose to send)</li>
      <li>Passwords or account credentials</li>
      <li>Contact list, SMS messages, or calendar events</li>
      <li>Precise GPS location for analytics or tracking</li>
      <li>Biometric data or sensitive personal categories</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. On-device sensor and tool usage</h2>
    <p>
      Smart Tools uses several hardware sensors and permissions to provide its features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera &amp; flash:</strong> flashlight / torch, QR &amp; barcode scanning, OCR.</li>
      <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> measuring sound levels for the decibel meter.</li>
      <li><strong>Accelerometer / gyroscope:</strong> spirit level and inclinometer readings.</li>
      <li><strong>Magnetometer:</strong> compass and metal detector.</li>
      <li><strong>Light sensor:</strong> lux meter.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage access / file creation:</strong> exporting scan results to CSV or PDF
          files when you explicitly choose to save or share them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sensor readings are used only in real time to display measurements.
      These readings are processed locally on your device and are not sent to
      any server by the Developer.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Camera, images and OCR</h2>
    <p>
      For QR / barcode scanning and OCR (text recognition), the App may use the
      camera or images you select from your gallery. Images are processed to
      detect codes or extract text that you can view, edit and export.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Developer does not upload your images, codes, or OCR results to any
      server. If you choose to export results (for example, as CSV or PDF) or
      share them with other apps, this is done under your control using your
      device’s standard share or save dialogs.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Advertising and analytics (third-party services)</h2>
    <p>
      The App may display ads, including rewarded ads, using third-party
      services such as <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. These providers may
      automatically collect certain information from your device, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile advertising ID (for example, Google Advertising ID)</li>
      <li>Approximate location (e.g., based on IP address)</li>
      <li>Device information (model, OS version, language)</li>
      <li>App usage information related to ad display and performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data collection is performed directly by the third-party provider and
      is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. The Developer does not
      have access to data that can personally identify you from these providers.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      For more information, please see:
      <br />
      Google Privacy Policy –
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>
    </p>

    <h2>7. Purchases and billing</h2>
    <p>
      Smart Tools may offer a premium upgrade using the official
      <strong>Google Play Billing</strong> system. Payment details (such as
      credit card information) are handled by Google Play and are not visible
      to the Developer. The Developer receives only non-personal information
      (e.g., that a purchase was successfully completed).
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Collection &amp; Processing – Server-Side Verification</h2>

    <h3>Purchase &amp; Reward Verification</h3>
    <p>
      When you make an in-app purchase or watch a rewarded advertisement, the App
      performs <strong>server-side verification</strong> to prevent fraud and duplicate rewards.
      During this process, the App may send limited information to our verification service.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data sent to the verification server may include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transaction ID</li>
      <li>Purchase token (sent for verification; stored only as a cryptographic hash)</li>
      <li>Anonymous user identifier (UUID generated by the App)</li>
      <li>Package name</li>
      <li>Reward metadata (reward amount / reward item)</li>
      <li>Optional custom data (if used, it must not include personal information)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data is used <strong>only</strong> to verify legitimate purchases, prevent replay attacks,
      and prevent duplicate ad rewards. It is not used for profiling, and it is not combined with
      information that would identify you as a real person.
    </p>

    <h3>Processing and retention</h3>
    <p>
      Verification is processed using <strong>Cloudflare Workers</strong>.
      Verification data is stored temporarily for fraud prevention and validation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rewarded ad verification:</strong> up to <strong>30 days</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Purchase verification records:</strong> up to <strong>1 year</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After these periods expire, the data is deleted or automatically purged.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloudflare logging and IP processing</h3>
    <p>
      Cloudflare may process IP addresses and request metadata for security, abuse prevention,
      and logging purposes. This information is handled according to Cloudflare’s privacy and
      security practices.
    </p>

    <h3>Key points</h3>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Data Sent</th>
          <th>PII?</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Transaction ID</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Prevent replay attacks / duplicate claims</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Purchase token (stored as hash)</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Verify purchase with Google Play</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>User ID (UUID)</td>
          <td>No*</td>
          <td>Track rewards per device/user without real identity</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Package name</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>API requirement / validation</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="muted">
      *The UUID is an anonymous identifier generated by the App and is not linked to your real-world identity.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Smart Tools may use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (advertising and rewarded ads)</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> (purchases)</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Developer API</strong> (purchase verification)</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Workers</strong> (verification processing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not maintain remote user accounts or cloud storage managed
      by the Developer. Measurement values and locally stored scan results
      remain on your device and can be cleared or deleted by you (for example,
      using “clear” / “delete” options in the App or by uninstalling the App).
    </p>
    <p>
      Third-party services (such as advertising providers and Google Play) may
      retain data according to their own policies.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your choices and controls</h2>
    <p>You can control many aspects of data and permissions, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Device permissions:</strong> You can grant or revoke camera,
        microphone, storage and other permissions at any time in your device’s
        system settings. The related tools may not function without those
        permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertising preferences:</strong> On Android, you can reset your
        advertising ID or limit ad personalization in the system settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App uninstall:</strong> You can stop all use of the App and its
        data by uninstalling it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for general audiences and is not directed specifically
      at children under the age of 13. The App does not knowingly collect
      personal data from children. If you believe that a child has provided
      personal information through the App, please contact the Developer so that
      such information can be removed if necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>13. International users</h2>
    <p>
      The App may be used by users in different countries. Third-party services
      (such as Google) may process information on servers located in various
      regions. By using the App, you consent to any such processing performed by
      those third parties in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The Developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Any changes will be published on this page with an updated “Last updated”
      date. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted will be
      considered acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
